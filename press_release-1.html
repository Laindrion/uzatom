                    An international conference on food security will be held in Samarkand on September 7-8 this year.
                    About 70 foreign ministers of agriculture are expected to participate in this conference, which will
                    be held in cooperation with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and
                    the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Uzbekistan.

                    Food security is one of the most urgent global problems, and the governments of all countries of the
                    world are trying to find a solution to this problem. The need to fundamentally change the current
                    approaches and views on food production and distribution is being repeatedly emphasized from the
                    highest platforms, including the UN and its Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Because,
                    according to scientists, if rational use is established, the existing agriculture, forestry and
                    fishing farms are able to fully supply humanity with food and create a source of income for the
                    population as in the pamphlet.

                    Unfortunately, indifference to nature, increasing anthropogenic influence on it, wastage, growing
                    difference in the food balance between developed and developing countries, and climate change are
                    causing a number of negative factors. Natural gifts, fresh water, seas, forests, biodiversity are
                    rapidly decreasing, land fertility is decreasing and soil is being degraded.
                    As a result, humanity is threatened by dire dangers such as malnutrition, hunger, and deterioration
                    of the population's lifestyle. According to UN data, by 2050 the number of hungry people in the
                    world will reach 2 billion. reaches a person. Malnutrition-related death rates among children also
                    show alarming figures.

                    There is another side to the matter. Agriculture is the largest employer in the world. Today, 40
                    percent of the population of the planet makes a living through this industry. It is a major source
                    of income and employment for families in impoverished villages. According to the data, five million
                    smallholder farms, mostly dryland, supply 80 percent of food in developing countries. Therefore, the
                    development of this sector will be a solid foundation for improving the lifestyle of the general
                    population.

                    It should be said that ensuring food security is a guarantee of ensuring the independence,
                    socio-economic and political stability of Uzbekistan as well as all other countries. This problem
                    has not lost its relevance in our country. At the same time, the demand for food products is
                    increasing, and the per capita consumption is increasing due to population growth.
                    At this point, it is worth noting that the issue of ensuring food security in Uzbekistan is given
                    priority at the state level. In particular, the adoption of the Decree of the head of our country on
                    January 16, 2018 "On measures to further ensure the country's food security" and the "Strategy for
                    the development of Uzbekistan's agriculture for 2020-2030" was a turning point in this regard.
                    After all, the strategy indicates that the share of undernourished people in Uzbekistan as of 2018
                    is 6.3 percent. Reducing this share to 5 percent by 2021, to 3 percent by 2025, and to zero by 2030
                    is set as a priority.

                <p class="post__text">
                    A number of practical measures are being taken to ensure food security in Uzbekistan. In particular,
                    the legislation aimed at ensuring productive and efficient use of land and water resources in
                    agriculture is being further strengthened; the share of food products in the composition of
                    agricultural products is increasing.
                </p>
                <p class="post__text">
                    Another important direction is the improvement of the water use system in order to grow agricultural
                    food products in the necessary volumes. After all, the introduction of drip irrigation technologies
                    allows to reduce the volume of mineral fertilizers to a certain extent. This will help to reduce the
                    cost of food and solve the problem of land quality deterioration..
