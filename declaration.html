                        We recognize that LLDCs face unique challenges, including geographical isolation, high
                        transportation
                        costs,
                        and vulnerability to climate change, that hinder their food security and nutrition and economic
                        development.
                        Despite these challenges, LLDCs possess significant potential that, if properly harnessed, can
                        contribute to
                        sustainable agrifood systems across the world.

                        We recognize that rapid population growth in LLDCs, urbanization, growing wealth and consequent
                        changes
                        in

                        address
                        the specific circumstances of LLDCs, focusing on enhancing productivity, resilience and market

                        particularly
                        vulnerable to the impacts of climate change on land, ecosystems and water resources.
