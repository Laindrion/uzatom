                    The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is a specialized agency of the
                    United Nations that leads international efforts to promote food security. The goal of the
                    Organization is to ensure food security for all and to promote the constant access of the population
                    to high quality food. With 195 members (194 countries and the European Union), FAO operates in more
                    than 130 countries around the world. FAO pays particular attention to gender equality and inclusion
                    in its work. Uzbekistan became a member of FAO on October 2, 2001, and since 2014, FAO has opened
                    its country office. In line with the national sustainable development priorities, FAO is committed
                    to supporting the government of Uzbekistan in implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
                    Development and helping the country achieve sustainable food systems across the entire agrifood
                    value chain.

                    $9.72 million and 24 national projects worth $5.31 million). The largest of them are “Promotion of
                    water saving technologies in the Uzbek water scarce area of the transboundary Podshaota river
                    basin”, “Institutional capacity building to develop organic agriculture and to promote Good
                    Agriculture Practices (GAP) in Uzbekistan”, “Integrated forest land and tree resources assessment”,

                    high-level meetings were held, and participation in 5 conferences was also taken. Proposals were
                    developed that were reflected in the decisions of the FAO Council, as well as in the results of the
                    UN Summit on Food Systems.

                    It is important to note that FAO provided assistance in the development of the Agriculture
                    Development Strategy of the Republic of Uzbekistan for 2020-2030, a fundamental document that
                    determines the priorities and main directions for the development of the country's agri-food sector.
                    As part of the implementation of projects in Uzbekistan, FAO strongly supports the implementation of
                    the Strategy.

                    At the same time, FAO is also supporting the improvement of the regulatory framework for

                    Since 2018, the number and amount of projects launched by FAO in Uzbekistan has been steadily
                    growing. The largest increase occurs in 2020 and 2021 - the period of Uzbekistan's chairmanship of
                    the FAO Regional Conference, when 26 regional and national grant projects worth $32 million were
                    launched. The main donors of projects implemented at the regional level are the Global Environment
                    Facility, the Green Climate Fund, the World bank, as well as the governments of Turkey, China, the
                    Republic of Korea, Japan, etc. Currently, with the technical support of FAO, work is underway to
                    attract a grant from the Global Environment Facility in the amount of $6.5 million to combat climate
                    change, mitigate its effects and adapt agriculture economy to climate change.

                    food security issues. And now preparations are underway for another major international forum - on
