                    The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is a specialized agency of the
                    United Nations that leads international efforts to promote food security. The goal of the
                    Organization is to ensure food security for all and to promote the constant access of the population
                    to high quality food. With 195 members (194 countries and the European Union), FAO operates in more
                    than 130 countries around the world. FAO pays particular attention to gender equality and inclusion
                    in its work. Uzbekistan became a member of FAO on October 2, 2001, and since 2014, FAO has opened
                    its country office. In line with the national sustainable development priorities, FAO is committed
                    to supporting the government of Uzbekistan in implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
                    Development and helping the country achieve sustainable food systems across the entire agrifood
                    value chain.

                    Development Strategy of the Republic of Uzbekistan for 2020-2030, a fundamental document that
