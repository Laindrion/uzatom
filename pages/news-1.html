                            energy was held in Samarkand
                        </h2>

                        <p class="news__inner-descr">
                            On December 5, 2024, an international conference dedicated to the development and peaceful
                            use of atomic energy was held in Samarkand.
                            The event was opened by the Presidential Press Secretary, Sherzod Asadov, with a message
                            from the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan to the participants of the international
                            conference. In his address, the head of state emphasized the importance of the peaceful
                            application of nuclear energy as an alternative means of improving quality of life and
                            achieving national development strategies.
                            He also expressed deep gratitude to the Director General of the International Atomic Energy
                            Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, for his support and participation in this significant event.
                            The President noted that the choice of Samarkand — a city that has historically connected
                            East and West — underscores its status as a center of global dialogue.
                            Following the President’s address, Rafael Mariano Grossi delivered a speech in which he
                            highlighted the importance of international cooperation in nuclear energy for achieving
                            sustainable development and combating climate change. He emphasized that atomic energy could
                            play a pivotal role in reducing dependence on hydrocarbons and ensuring energy security.
                            Grossi also stressed the necessity of adopting the latest technologies and safety standards,
                            noting that the world must unite to create safe and sustainable energy systems. He highly
                            praised Uzbekistan’s adopted strategy for the development of its national nuclear program
                            and expressed the IAEA’s readiness to support Uzbekistan in this vital area.
