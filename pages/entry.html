                    Passports and Visa Requirements
                </h2>
                <p>
                    All participants should ensure that their passports’ validity exceeds six months, and in all cases,
                    longer than the stay’s duration, and ensure they obtain a valid visa before entering the Republic of
                    Uzbekistan.

                    Affairs: <a href=" https://mfa.uz/en/pages/visa-republic-uzb">

                        there is no diplomatic representation of Uzbekistan, visa can be obtained on arrival, subject to
                        uploading valid passport and recent photo during the registration process.</u>

                    Upon entry into the Republic of Uzbekistan, it is strictly prohibited for travelers to bring in
                    items such as drugs, firearms, or ammunition. While departing from the country, travelers are
                    permitted to carry an unrestricted amount of foreign currency; however, if the cash exceeds 100
                    million soms (equivalent to approximately 8000 US dollars), it is mandatory to declare the amount
                    using the T-6 form.
