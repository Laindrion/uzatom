                            Innovation and Education for the Development of Atomic Energy in OIC Countries
                        </h2>

                        <p class="news__inner-descr">
                            Speakers at the final panel session of the international conference discussed key priorities
                            in education, innovation, and technology integration for the peaceful use of atomic energy
                            in OIC countries.
                            The session focused on the importance of implementing advanced technologies and innovative
                            solutions in nuclear energy. Participants emphasized the role of scientific and applied
                            research in advancing safe and efficient methods for utilizing atomic energy.
                            Additionally, the discussion highlighted the strengthening of educational initiatives to
                            prepare highly qualified professionals for the atomic sector. This effort is seen as a
                            foundation for the sustainable development of atomic energy in the region.
                            The international conference served as a platform for exchanging knowledge and experience in
                            the safe and efficient use of atomic energy for sustainable development.
                            It provided a unique opportunity for industry experts to share successful examples of atomic
                            technology implementation, discuss its impact on the economy, environment, and public
                            welfare, and identify ways to strengthen international cooperation.
