                    Nuclear energy plays a critical role in sustainable development, contributing to energy security and
                    reducing climate risks. Uzbekistan is actively advancing the peaceful use of nuclear energy by
                    developing its national nuclear infrastructure, with a strong focus on scientific progress, the safe
                    application of nuclear technologies, and the training of qualified specialists.
                </p>

                <p>
                    By 2030, Uzbekistan aims to establish a reliable, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly
                    electricity supply by creating a comprehensive national nuclear infrastructure. A key priority is
                    the
                    construction of a small modular nuclear power plant (SMR), which will enhance national expertise and
                    strengthen Uzbekistan's international standing in the nuclear sector.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In this context, the support of the IAEA, including technical assistance, regulatory framework
                    development, and safety assessments, is especially vital. The experience of leading nuclear
                    countries
                    (Russia, the United States, Western Europe, Japan, South Korea, and China) demonstrates that nuclear
                    technologies foster scientific innovation, digitalization, and economic growth. In Uzbekistan,
                    nuclear
                    technology applications such as nuclear medicine, isotope production, data centers, and research
                    reactors have the potential to drive the transition toward an innovative economy.

                    <strong> THE PURPOSE OF THE CONFERENCE </strong> is to discuss key issues related to the development
                    and use of nuclear
                    energy for peaceful purposes, including the legislative and institutional regulation, safety, and
                    the use of nuclear technologies across various industries. The conference will also strengthen
                    international cooperation and collaboration, as well as support the training of personnel for
                    Uzbekistan's nuclear industry.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The conference will convene experts from OIC countries, Central and South Asia, Russia, the Middle
                    East, the EU, the USA, the IAEA, the World Nuclear Association (WNA), and other international
                    organizations. It will serve as a platform for exchanging experiences on the peaceful use of nuclear
                    energy and fostering cooperation.

                    <li>
                        Consider the prospects for the use of nuclear energy in OIC countries, including the
                        development of nuclear energy in Uzbekistan and plans for the construction of nuclear power
                        plants.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Identify the role of international organizations, such as the IAEA, in supporting the safe
                        use of nuclear energy.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Discuss environmental and social aspects of nuclear energy in OIC countries in the context of
