                            A press briefing
                        </h2>

                        <p class="news__inner-descr">
                            At International Conference on atomic energy, a press briefing was held featuring the
                            Director General of the IAEA, Rafael Mariano Grossi, and the Director of the Atomic Energy
                            Agency under the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan, Azim Akhmedkhadjev.
                            In his speech, Rafael Mariano Grossi emphasized the significance of international
                            cooperation among OIC countries in the field of atomic energy, highlighting its potential
                            for sustainable development, economic stability, and combating climate change. He stressed
                            the importance of transferring international practices and developing educational programs
                            that ensure the safe use of atomic energy.
                            Azim Akhmedkhadjayev, in turn, expressed gratitude for the results of the conference, which
                            was attended by 500 delegates, including 150 representatives from 30 countries. He noted the
                            key importance of engaging international partners in the project for building small modular
                            nuclear power plants in Uzbekistan. Akhmedkhadjaev emphasized that international cooperation
                            plays a critical role in ensuring energy security and addressing climate change, expressing
                            hope for continued dialogue among participating countries. The conference served as an
                            effective platform for exchanging opinions and knowledge among experts and young
                            professionals in the field of atomic energy.
