                            Atomic Energy as a Stable and Environmentally Friendly Source of Electricity
                        </h2>

                        <p class="news__inner-descr">
                            As part of the International Conference program, a plenary session was held focusing on the
                            prospects of atomic energy usage in OIC countries, including the development of atomic
                            energy in Uzbekistan.
                            The discussion centered on the key advantages of implementing the SMR (Small Modular
                            Reactor) project for Uzbekistan and Central Asia. These include providing a stable and
                            environmentally friendly source of electricity, improving the country’s energy security, and
                            creating new opportunities for economic growth.
                            Among the speakers were Rafael Mariano Grossi, Director General of the International Atomic
                            Energy Agency (IAEA); Jurabek Mirzamakhmudov, Minister of Energy of the Republic of
                            Uzbekistan; Sama Bilbao y León, Director General of the World Nuclear Association; Azim
                            Akhmedkhadjaev, Director of the Atomic Energy Agency under the Cabinet of Ministers of the
                            Republic of Uzbekistan; Andrey Rozhdestvin, Director General of REP Joint Stock Company;
                            Abduvakkos Rafikov, Chairman of the Committee on Industry, Radiation, and Nuclear Safety
                            under the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan; and Justin Friedman, Senior
                            Advisor at the Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation, U.S. Department of
                            State.
                            The speakers highlighted the energy and climate challenges that demand global efforts to
                            increase the share of clean energy sources, including nuclear energy. It was emphasized that
                            for countries aspiring to sustainable development, atomic energy offers new perspectives and
                            significant opportunities.
